Hello, my name is Mark Sayson, and I'm a computer science student and software developer.  In May 2017 I'll graduate from the University of British Columbia with a B.Sc. in Computer Science.

I've focused my upper-year coursework in distributed systems, computer security, algorithms, databases and machine learning, and look forward to developing robust systems that expand the realm of the possible.

I entered the software industry in 2011, starting in quality assurance and test platform development where I worked with other engineers to identify potential user issues and solutions, validate systems, and expand automated testing efforts.

In 2014 I took on my first position as a junior software developer at Tasktop Technologies, where I learned a great deal about agile development and practices for continually improving the product, the codebase, and way the product is developed.  I returned in 2016 to develop data collection and reporting services for a new engineering dashboard, which brought immediate improvements to monitoring of engineering work and build health across products and teams.

I continue to enjoy learning and exploring new ideas, and appreciate being able to work on challenging projects where there are still technical problems to be solved.  In my free time I like to read, and play and teach the strategic board game Go.
