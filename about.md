My name is Mark Sayson, and I'm a software developer based in Seattle, WA, USA, with a focus on developing distributed backend services.

I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer at Amazon, leading and collaborating on cross-team initiatives to automate company-wide security and consumer privacy.

I enjoy learning and exploring new ideas, and spending free time with my wife and daughter, reading, and playing and teaching the strategic board game Go.
