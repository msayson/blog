Hello!  My name is Mark Sayson, and Iâ€™m a fourth year computer science student at the University of British Columbia.

My main interests are in technology and the sciences, and I enjoy discussing new ideas and working on challenging problems.  In my free time I also like to read online and offline, spend time with friends, and play and teach the strategic board game Go.
