Hello, my name is Mark Sayson, and I'm a software developer living in Seattle, WA, USA.

In May 2017 I graduated with a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia, where I had the opportunity to take a variety of challenging classes, attend seminars, and participate in the UBC Co-operative Program to work in software development between study terms.  I focused my coursework on distributed systems, computer security, algorithms, and machine learning.

I entered the software industry in 2011, starting in quality assurance and test platform development where I worked with other engineers to identify potential user issues and solutions, validate systems, and expand automated testing efforts.

In 2014 I took my first position as a junior software developer at Tasktop Technologies, where I learned a great deal about agile development and practices for continually improving products, the codebase, and way products are developed.  I returned in 2016 to develop data collection and reporting services for a new engineering dashboard, which brought immediate improvements to monitoring of engineering work and product build health across teams.

I'm currently working at Amazon as a software development engineer, and am excited to contribute to robust, scalable technologies that will improve life for millions of users around the world.

I enjoy learning and exploring new ideas, and appreciate being able to work on challenging projects where there are interesting technical problems to be solved.  In my free time I like to read, and play and teach the strategic board game Go.
